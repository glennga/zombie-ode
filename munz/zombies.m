function [ ] = zombies(a,b,ze,d,T,dt)
% This function will solve the system of ODE’s for the basic model used in
% the Zombie Dynamics project for MAT 5187. It will then plot the curve of
% the zombie population based on time.
% Function Inputs: a - alpha value in model: "zombie destruction" rate
%                  b - beta value in model: "new zombie" rate
%                  ze - zeta value in model: zombie resurrection rate
%                  d - delta value in model: background death rate
%                  T - Stopping time
%                  dt - time step for numerical solutions
